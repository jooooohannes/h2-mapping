    This class is used to calculate some basic metrics over the network like

     closeness_centrality   :   reciprocal of sum of shortest path form node u to all other nodes
     communicability        :   sum of closest walk from node u to node v
     load_centrality        :   fraction of all the shortest path passes from that node
     nodes_pagerank         :   ranking of the nodes in the graph g on basis on incoming links
